# DES-001 Learning Log

## 2026-05-14 — Topic 1 UI vs UX

### What was studied

- Difference between UI and UX
- Source comparison across Figma, NN/g, IxDF, and UXDT
- Further-reading ladder using heuristics, UX Honeycomb, GOV.UK user needs, and W3C accessibility framing

### What changed in understanding

UI is the visible and interactive interface layer. UX is the broader task journey and trust experience. In a data-review tool, UX includes credibility and uncertainty signalling, not only ease of use.

### Repository outputs created

- `docs/design-foundations-v2.html`
- `docs/design-foundations-app/`
- `design/foundations/ui-vs-ux-further-reading.md`
- `design/checklists/master-browser-design-checklist.md`

### Open work

- Execute Topic 1 exercises
- Record lab results
- Complete quiz
- Submit and grade DES-001

## 2026-05-14 — Lab 01 UI vs UX Browser Audit executed

### What was executed

Lab 01 was executed against:

```text
docs/destination-master-browser-v1.html
```

The lab converted Topic 1 from reading evidence into applied coursework evidence.

### Exercises completed

- Exercise A: UI inventory
- Exercise B: UX journey map
- Exercise C: Nielsen heuristic mini-audit
- Exercise D: UX Honeycomb score

### Key finding

The browser already supports a basic QA/review workflow through search, filters, stats, warnings, cards, metadata, and chips. However, the reviewer journey is incomplete because v1 lacks reset, sort, table mode, full-record inspection, active-filter summary, and repeated trust signalling in deeper contexts.

### Repository outputs created

- `design/foundations/topic-01-ui-vs-ux-exercise-results.md`
- `courses/des-001-design-foundations/submissions/lab-01-ui-vs-ux-browser-audit-results.md`
- updated `courses/des-001-design-foundations/competency-map.md`

### What changed in understanding

The main v1 issue is not aesthetics. It is workflow completion and trust preservation. v1.1 should improve the review sequence:

```text
browse → narrow → compare → inspect → recover → leave with correct trust level
```

### Next action

Update the grade report and decide whether to implement Destination Master Browser v1.1 immediately or continue with DES-001 Topic 2 first.
