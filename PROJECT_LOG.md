## 2026-05-12 — Destination tag dictionary v2 and HTML browser created

Type: taxonomy / artifact / interface

Summary:

Expanded the destination tag dictionary into v2 and created a GitHub Pages HTML browser for taxonomy review. The taxonomy now covers destination scale, destination types, vibes, traveller fit, trip styles, caution tags, source confidence, source types, and workflow statuses.

Files changed:

- `datasets/reference/destination_tag_dictionary.md`
- `docs/destination-tag-dictionary.html`
- `docs/index.html`

Evidence produced:

- expanded controlled vocabulary for destination database v2
- interactive taxonomy browser
- Pages landing page link for tag dictionary review

Next action:

Use the tag dictionary to validate the 225-row India candidate backlog and identify non-standard tags before promotion.

## 2026-05-12 — Destination database v2 massive expansion setup

Type: dataset / reference / strategy

Summary:

Started the destination database v2 scale-up. Added a strategy document for building a massive Planner-ready destination database, a controlled tag dictionary, and a 225-row India-only expansion backlog. The system now separates seed destinations from candidate backlog entries so the database can grow without contaminating Planner-ready records.

Files changed:

- `datasets/reference/destination_database_v2_strategy.md`
- `datasets/reference/destination_tag_dictionary.md`
- `datasets/reference/destination_expansion_backlog_india_v1.csv`
- `DATASETS.md`

Evidence produced:

- target scale strategy from 250 rows to 5,000+ rows
- controlled destination vocabulary
- 225 India expansion candidates
- dataset registry scale snapshot showing 359 total seed + candidate records

Next action:

Create a QA/deduplication and promotion pipeline that converts selected backlog candidates into enriched destination records.

## 2026-05-12 — Destination browser v2 and QA report created

Type: artifact / evidence / interface

Summary:

Created a destination database QA report and a GitHub Pages-compatible enriched destination browser v2. Browser v2 loads the 134-row destination seed CSV and applies client-side heuristic enrichment for Planner-style review.

Files changed:

- `reports/evidence/destination-database-qa-v1.md`
- `docs/destination-browser-v2.html`
- `docs/index.html`

Evidence produced:

- destination database QA v1 report
- enriched browser with origin-fit, infant-suitability, fatigue, planning-complexity, medical-access, and Planner-readiness filters
- Pages landing page updated with v2 link

Next action:

Stabilise enrichment rules into a committed enriched CSV or add destination scoring v1 using the v2 enrichment fields.

## 2026-05-05 — HTML artifact layer and destination browser created
